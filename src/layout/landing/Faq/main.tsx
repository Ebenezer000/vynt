        "Sellers list their pre-loved (or brand new!) fashion items, and buyers browse, shop, and get these gems delivered to their door. Just download the app, and let the thrifting adventure begin!",

      question: "Why should I thrift on Vynt instead of buying new?",

        "Thrifting on Vynt is not only kinder on your wallet but also kinder on the planet. By shopping second-hand, you're reducing fashion waste.",

        "You can sell pre-loved (or even brand new!) clothing, shoes, accessories, and all things fashion. Got a vintage jacket, trendy sneakers, or a quirky hat that needs a new home? \n Vynt's the place to list it! ðŸ‘—ðŸ‘ ðŸ§¢",

    {
      question: "Do I have to sell only second-hand stuff?",
      answer:
        "Nope! While we're all about sustainability, we also love a good brand-new piece. So if you've got tags-still-on items or clothes you bought but never wore (we've all been there ðŸ˜…), go ahead and list them. As long as it's fashion-related, you can sell it!",
